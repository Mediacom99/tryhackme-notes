// Simple calculator that implements +,-,*,/ using reverse Polish Notation for positive integers only as input

int main(void)
{
  /* Sweep through the input until EOF or '\n' (while)
     For each char do this: (switch char read from stdin)
     1. check if its number, operator or something else
     2. if number then push it onto stack, augment head by one
     3. if operator than pop two (each time decrementing head), calculate, push result (increment head)
     4. if is enter or EOF, print the top element of the stack and end, otherwise ignore and break out of switch.
     The stack is a global array of chars, the free position is
     saved as another global variable (head).

     Like this works only with integer numbers, I could then add a way to include double numbers written like 1234.23456...
     I could use the ungetc function from std library to distinguish between adjacent double numbers, like
     123.3435_789.989898+ where I add the operator '_'(95 in dec) to signal the end of a double number.
     Then I could also add the operator mod % and provisions for negative numbers, also commands to clear the stack
