# Burp Suite - Web Application Penetration Testing

## What is Burp Suite ?

Burp Suite captures and enables manipulation of all the HTTP/HTTPS traffic between a browser and a web server. It can intercept requests, route them to various tools in Burp Suite Framework, it can view and modify web requests also. 
Invaluable tool for manual web application testing.

I will be using: Burp Suite Community Edition (free)

Key features of Community Edition:

    1. Proxy : enables interception and modifications of web requests
    2. Repeater : capture, modify and resend same request multiple times
    3. Intruder : spraying endpoints with request (rate limited on community edition)
    4. Decoder : decode captured information or encode payloads before sending to target
    5. Comparer : comparison of two pieces of data either at word or byte level
    6. Sequencer : assess randomness of token, such as session cookie value or other random g                   enerated data.
