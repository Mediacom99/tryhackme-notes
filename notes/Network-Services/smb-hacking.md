Scanning and Hacking Server Message Block SMB servers.

What to start ? Ip address and port of the SMB server

Used tools:

	1. enum4linux -> wrapper around samba library, gets info like users, shares, groups, os version from a samba compatible SMB share
	2. smbclient -> client to access a SMB share and tranfer files to and from it
